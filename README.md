# OO
A secure boot, very simple, to all Micropython boards.
The oo.py use the 'VCP+MCP' mode, so the file system could be mounted auto by a computer... In this case, the security depend too of the computer...
The ooo.py use only the VCP mode, so the cost is no file system... Only screen software works to have acces to the board... So I have added a file with the basics screen commands to copy and view a file which coul be great to copy BEFORE on the board.
